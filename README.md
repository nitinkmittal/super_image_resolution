# Super-resolution of images using Deep Learning 


## Motivation

Computer vision algorithms have become a critical component of applications we use every day. Major
use-cases include object detection, object classication, semantic segmentation, and pattern recognition.
However, the performance of these algorithms is dependent on the quality of input data which is mostly
pictorial. In practical applications, often the available pictorial data is of low quality, aected by factors
such as low resolution, presence of noise, hallucination, and pixelation of objects within an image, etc.

Therefore, the project explores state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning to generate high-resolution
images from otherwise low-resolution counterparts to resolve these challenges. In real-world applications,
improving quality of available pictorial data will help computer vision techniques achieve better results.

## Dataset

There are 2 phases of this project. In phase-1, the project specifcally targeted to provide deep learning
models to perform super-resolution on images of humans faces. For this, the project used the [fake human
faces dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffheaton/glasses-or-no-glasses) which contains nearly 5000 images of fake human faces generated by GANs. In
phase-2, the project will target to provide deep learning models to perform super-resolution of breast cancer
histology images. For this, the project will use the BACH dataset from ICIAR 2018 grand challenge which
contains nearly 400 H&E stained breast histology microscopy images.

## Sampling from WSI
```bash{python}
python generate_samples.py <svs> <samples_dir>

python generate_samples.py --help

usage: generate_samples.py [-h] -svs SVS -samples_dir SAMPLES_DIR [-recursive_svs_search RECURSIVE_SVS_SEARCH] [-create_samples_dir CREATE_SAMPLES_DIR] [-num_samples_per_svs NUM_SAMPLES_PER_SVS] [-sample_size SAMPLE_SIZE]
                           [-max_attempt_per_sample MAX_ATTEMPT_PER_SAMPLE]

Run random sampling over svs files and save samples
